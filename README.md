# python-final-project

# This final project aims to compare multiple restaurants menu items and see which all contain that is similar and what each restaurant has that is unique
# PURPOSE: the use case is to help individuals find their specific restaurant that can appeal to a group of people trying to choose a place or to find a place that has food items youre looking for even if the menus may be different, they still may have some similar options across the board.
# Additionally the csv files can be changed out with minor tweaking any restaurants can be applied to this script for an easy comparison.
# Pandas was used as we recently learned about the time saving and easier commands the pandas library has to offer.

# lets talk uses of the HMENU, the goal was to explain the app in detail showing the best amount of information.
# using -h gives a help menu, this also appears when putting in incorrect h menu options as this helps sort all the functinos of this python app.
# using -a tells about the app, gives background to what the list will look like when run, and tells about the restaraunts featured in the comparison.
# using -c allows for a regex amongst emails to be run and filter out a list of incorrect emails, only giving accurate places you can contact the restaraunts for questions
# using -r is the actual run, this allows for the script to be run, the csvs to compared, and unique and similar food items are pushed into a csv which is then printed into the terminal, formatted through pandas.
# finally, -e allows for the exit of the script, and a conclusion printed out.

# Time took to complete: this took over 10+ hours of research and learning over the span of about a week.
# Things I learned: everything about pandas, I learned about merging, I learned about regex using pandas, and I learned about pushing things into creating csv and how to read from the csv.
